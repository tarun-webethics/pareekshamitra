## 🔑 API Key Security

In the current setup, the Claude API is called directly from the browser. This is fine for personal use and development. For production deployment:

1. Create a backend proxy (Node.js/Express or Next.js API route)
2. Store the API key in server environment variables
3. Route all Claude calls through your backend

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Desktop (≥1024px):** Full sidebar + main content layout
- **Mobile (<1024px):** Top bar + bottom tab navigation

---

## 🧩 Adding New Exams

Edit `src/data/exams.js` and add a new entry to the `EXAMS` array:

```js
{
  id: "cat",
  name: "CAT",
  fullName: "Common Admission Test",
  icon: "📈",
  color: "pink",
  subjects: ["Verbal Ability", "Data Interpretation", "Logical Reasoning"],
  level: "National",
}
```

The exam will automatically appear in Quiz, Settings, Leaderboard, and all other pages.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the `build/` folder to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.
